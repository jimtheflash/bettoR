#' @title Bet Probability
#'
#' @description This function returns the win, loss, and push probabilities of a given bet based on the current line and your predicted line.
#'
#' @param pred_spread Predicted spread for the team you want to bet on
#' @param spread Spread for the team that you want to bet on (-3.5, -7, 4, 2.5)
#' @param sport Sport/League of the teams being bet on. Possible values are:
#' * `NBA`, National Basketball Association
#' * `NCAAB`, College Basketball
#' * `NFL`, National Football League
#' * `NCAAF`, College Football
#'
#' @return probs Plot of the simulation as well as the percentage of simulations that were positive and negative.
